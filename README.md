#UofT Hacks Project - Virtual Reality Portal

[DEMO] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?x-yt-ts=1422579428&v=OR3tM0cnzZE&x-yt-cl=85114404)

Allows for user to play Portal 2 using a [Myo Gestrue Control Armband] (https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/), [Google Cardboard](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/) / [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/) and a Wii remote.

Directional input is handled by the virtual reality headset of choice, whether it be the Oculus or the Google Cardboard through an Android device. The Myo armband is responsible for shooting portals in game as well as grabbing items in game via predetermined gestures. The Wii remote is used for its accelerometer, which is used to detect tilt in the users body; allowing one to move forward/jump in game.
